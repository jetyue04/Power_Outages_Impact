# Power Outages: An Investigative Analysis

### by Jet Yue and Namitha Vishnupad

# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to our analysis of power outages across the United States. The core of this project's data consists of detailed records of major power outages in the United States, which contains information about the causes of these outages, their duration, the number of people/consumers impacted, and various other socio-economic factors related to the impacted regions. 

Power outages are significant events, and can disrupt daily life, impact economic activities, and potentially pose risks to health and safety - especially ones on larger scales.

We aim to answer the question of finding the characteristics of major power outages with high severity, and whay risk factors an energy company might want to look into when predicting the location/severity of its next major power outage.


And we know it is hard to find a single answer to this question. So, we have narrowed our approach to be slightly more specific, with the following research question:

##### Is there a significant difference in the mean outage duration between major power outages caused by severe weather, and major power outages caused by intentional attacks?

This question aims to uncover whether the nature of the cause of the outage - whether it is natural or human induced, affects the duration of the power outage. The answer could potentially influence how resources are allocated for outage prevention, as well as inform strategies for improving the resilience of power infrastructure.


Before we take a look into our project, here is a brief introduction of what the data is!

The working dataset we are using has <b><span style="color:red">**1534 rows**</span></b> and <b><span style="color:blue">**36 columns**</span></b>. 

Shortly put - this is a lot of data ðŸ˜¬. 

For our approach, we have compiled a list of the data we feel is most relevant to our research question -


- OUTAGE.DURATION: Duration of the power outage in minutes.
- CAUSE.CATEGORY: Primary category of the cause of the outage (e.g., severe -weather, intentional attack).
- OUTAGE.START.DATE: Date when the outage started.
- OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE: Date when power was restored.
- CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED: Number of customers affected by the outage.
- U.S._STATE: Location of the outage
- CLIMATE.REGION: Climate region of the outage location.
- ANOMALY.LEVEL: Climate anomaly level during the time of the outage.
- RES.SALES, COM.SALES, IND.SALES: Electricity consumption patterns by residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.
- TOTAL.SALES: Total electricity sales in the affected area.
- PC.REALGSP.STATE: Per capita real Gross State Product.
- POPULATION: Population of the affected area.


# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

In the original dataset, there are several rows in the excel sheet encompassing a description of the data. We removed those rows before importing it into our notebook.

Below, we have displayed the first 5 rows of the original dataset:

As you can see, there is a lot of missing data, and it's not the most interpretable data. So with data cleaning, here are the changes we made -

1. Then, we combined the 'OUTAGE.START.DATE' and 'OUTAGE.START.TIME' columns into a single string for each row, handling missing values by replacing them with empty strings.
2. We then converted the combined date-time strings into datetime objects, coercing invalid entries to NaT values (Not a Time)
3. Only take out columns we are interested in
4. Check for unreasonable values:
    - Duration, Demand Loss and Customer affected should not be 0
    - all other columns's value are checked
    - REPLACE WITH NAN VALUES


In summation: The data cleaning steps transformed raw data into a structured and analyzable format. By filling missing values, combining date and time columns, calculating outage durations, and standardizing categorical data, we ensured that the dataset is ready for meaningful analysis. These steps were essential for achieving accurate and reliable insights into the characteristics and severity of major power outages, ultimately aiding in the identification of risk factors for future outages.

#### Univariate Analysis
For our univariate analysis, we explored the following plots 

We explored a couple more plots for our univariate analysis, but one of utmost interest to us was to pictographically visualize average power outages across the United States, which we did through a geomap (pictured below). We used median power outages to get a general understanding of the distribution across states in the USA.

We see that states like West Virginia and Michigan have significantly higher median power outage duration compared to other regions in the United States, which poses an interesting question of why this could be taking place.


#### Bivariate Analysis

For our bivariate analysis, we used a box plot to explore the differences in outage duration caused be different categories. Our choice of picking was between severe weather and intentional attacks, which we have pictured below:

<iframe
  src="assets/fig2.bivar_boxplot.html"
  width="800"
  height="600"

></iframe>

We see that with severe weather, there appears to be longer outages, both with a higher mean and a greater spread of durations, while intentional attacks tend to have shorter durations and fewer outliers.



### Interesting Aggregates
The following pivot table is a breakdown of the average outage duration by different cause categories in different climate regions. It gives  some insight into the power grids across the country, and helps identify what cause category is most significant per climate region

# Assessment of Missingness 

### NMAR Analysis 
As per our analysis of the columns in this dataset, we observed that the column CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAILS is potentially displaying NMAR. There are several inconsistencies in the data entry for this column, which make it appear as though it was manually entered by the researchers. For example, there are several variations of CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAILS containing 'wind' such as: 
- 'heavy wind', 'wind storm', 'wind', 'wind/rain' 
- 'snow/ice ', 'snow/ice storm' 

which are variations of the same cause category. 

Another example would be errors in the spacing of entries. For example, 'Hydro' and ' Hydro' are both unique entries in the column even though it is essentially the same cause category.


Here is a list of the variables found in CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL:

 [nan, 'vandalism', 'heavy wind', 'thunderstorm', 'winter storm', 'tornadoes', 'sabotage', 'hailstorm', 'uncontrolled loss', 'winter', 'wind storm', 'computer hardware', 'public appeal', 'storm', ' Coal', ' Natural Gas', 'hurricanes', 'wind/rain', 'snow/ice storm', 'snow/ice ', 'transmission interruption', 'flooding', 'transformer outage', 'generator trip', 'relaying malfunction', 'transmission trip', 'lightning', 'switching', 'shed load', 'line fault', 'breaker trip', 'wildfire', ' Hydro', 'majorsystem interruption', 'voltage reduction', 'transmission', 'Coal', 'substation', 'heatwave', 'distribution interruption', 'wind', 'suspicious activity', 'feeder shutdown', '100 MW loadshed', 'plant trip', 'fog', 'Hydro', 'earthquake', 'HVSubstation interruption', 'cables', 'Petroleum', 'thunderstorm; islanding', 'failure']

### Missingness Dependency

For our process of selecting which columns to explore missingness dependencies, we genereated a heatmap to visualize details:

We decided to explore the missingness dependency of **CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED** on **CAUSE.CATEGORY**. Essentially, our claim is that the missingness of Customers Affected is MAR dependent on the cause. We performed a permutation test to answer this question, and used total variation as our test statistic of choice.

The following barplot graphs the observed distribution of **CAUSE.CATEOGRY** separated by the missingess of the respective number of customers affected.

This is the observed distribution of permutation TVD's against our observed TVD. We see that our observed TVD (the red line) is situated to the right of main (blue) distribution, which indicates that our test generated a p-value of 0 (approximately).

This essentially implies that there is a **significant difference** in the distribution of customers affected and cause category. We can conclude that CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED is likely dependent on the values of CAUSE.CATEGORY, making it MAR dependent.

# Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis:** There is **no** significant difference in the outage duration of major power outages when caused by severe weather and outages caused by intentional attacks

**Alternative Hypothesis:** There **is** no significant difference in the outage duration of major power outages when caused by severe weather and outages caused by intentional attacks.

**Population:** The total set of outage durations across all categories and events present in the original dataset. 

**Sample size:** Subset of outage durations caused by severe weather and intentional attacks

We see here that the distributions have similar shapes, which is why we decided to use absolute difference in means as our test statistic.

**Test Statistic:** Absolute difference in means 

**Significance Level:** 0.05

**P-Value:** 0.0

  width="800"
  height="600"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>

This plot shows us that there is a significant difference between the 2 cause categories.

**Conclusion:** Since the P-value was 0.0 (< 0.05 significance level), we reject our null hypothesis that outage durations caused by severe weather has no significant difference to the outage durations caused by intentional attacks. This favours our alternative hypothesis, that there is in fact a significant difference in the outage duration caused by these different cause categories.
